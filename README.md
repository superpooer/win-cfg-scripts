#Quality of Life Improvement Pack
##Scripts for the Windows cmd
---------------------------------
##Current Contents:

*cdx.bat*
Change Directory eXtended (or enhanced or whatever)
Makes the prompt slightly more unix-like (or how I have my PS1 at least)
Currently shows `dir>_` where dir is the lowest level directory (and the underscore is a space)
May become more *feature-rich*, in that case will probably come with an "installer" to keep the actual cdx.bat as small as possible
